# Tex Cost Pro for Home Textile
Below is a **simple, universal, industry‑accepted costing logic** used across **Home Textiles**—and how it works differently for **large, medium, small, and extra-small** (individual) manufacturers.

I’ll explain:

*   The **one common formula** used across all scales
*   How each **department/process contributes**
*   How the formula **changes** (simple → advanced) based on company size
*   Step‑by‑step costing logic
*   Easy examples

No complicated jargon—just practical, real‑world costing.

# ✅ **1. The Universal Home Textile Cost Formula (Same for All Scales)**

Every home textile product—bedsheets, curtains, towels, cushions—uses **the same cost structure**, no matter the company size.

### **Master Formula**

    Total Cost = 
    (Material Cost)
    + (Processing Cost)
    + (Cutting & Sewing Cost)
    + (Finishing & Packing Cost)
    + (Overheads)
    + (Wastage Allowance)

If a department doesn’t exist in a small company, that section is simply **zero** or **merged**.

***

# ✅ **2. How Each Department Feeds Into Cost**

These inputs go into the formula:

### **Raw Material / Purchase / Stores**

*   Fabric/Yarn price
*   Trims (zips, labels, thread)
*   Packaging (polybag, carton)

### **Weaving / Knitting**

*   Loom time
*   Efficiency
*   Picks per inch / GSM impact

### **Dyeing / Printing**

*   Dye chemical usage
*   Print coverage
*   Batch weight

### **Cutting**

*   Marker efficiency
*   Fabric utilization
*   Wastage

### **Stitching / Tailoring**

*   SMV (time)
*   Labor rate
*   Line efficiency

### **Quality**

*   Reject %
*   Rework time

### **Finishing / Packing**

*   Ironing / folding time
*   Packing material usage

### **Overheads (General Factory + Admin)**

*   Electricity
*   Rent
*   Supervisor salaries
*   Machine depreciation

Some companies track these in detail; some just use a %.

# ✅ **3. The Same Formula at 4 Industry Scales (Simple Explanation)**

***

# 🟦 **1) Large-Scale Home Textile Industry (Export Factories)**

**Highly detailed costing**  
**Each department feeds separate cost data**

### **How it works**

*   Every activity has **standard time**, **machine rate**, **labor rate**, **overhead pool**.
*   Uses **BOM + Routing + Overhead absorption**.
*   Data comes from:  
    Weaving, Dyeing, Printing, Cutting, Stitching, QC, Packing, HR, IE, Accounts, Stores, Transport, Documentation.

### **Large Scale Formula**

    Material = Σ(BOM × Price × Wastage%)
    Process = Σ(Operation time × Rate/min × Efficiency)
    Overhead = Σ(Department pool ÷ Driver units)
    Wastage = Total × Wastage%

### **Characteristics**

*   Most accurate
*   ERP‑integrated
*   Real usage vs. standard usage tracking

***

# 🟩 **2) Medium-Scale Home Textile Industry**

**Partially detailed costing**  
Departments may be merged (ex: Cutting+Stitching, QA+Packing)

### **How it works**

*   Uses **BOM** but routing is simpler.
*   Uses **SMV × labor rate** for stitching.
*   Overheads often applied as a simple percentage (10–18%).

### **Medium Scale Formula**

    Material = BOM × Price × 1.X wastage factor
    Process = (Cutting SMV + Stitching SMV + Finishing SMV) × Labor rate
    Overhead = % of manufacturing cost

### **Characteristics**

*   Balanced accuracy
*   Easier to maintain
*   Useful for domestic manufacturers

***

# 🟧 **3) Small-Scale Textile Unit (Local factories / job-work units)**

**Simplified costing**  
Most work done by experience, not detailed measurement.

### **How it works**

*   No SMV study; time estimated by supervisor.
*   Overhead added as flat amount per piece.

### **Small Scale Formula**

    Material = Fabric Cost/meter × consumption + trims
    Labor = Per-piece stitching rate + cutting rate
    Dye/Print = Per-meter fixed job-work rate
    Overhead = Fixed amount/piece (e.g., ₹3–₹10)

### **Characteristics**

*   Quick calculation
*   Based on “market rate”
*   Good for job-work costing

***

# 🟨 **4) Extra Small / Individual (Tailors / Small Home Units)**

**Very basic costing**

### **How it works**

*   Material bought from market
*   Stitching charged per piece
*   No department cost splitting

### **Extra Small Formula**

    Material Cost = Fabric (meters × price/meter)
    Labor Cost = Stitching charge per piece
    Packing Cost = Simple polybag
    Profit Margin = Add 15–25%

### **Characteristics**

*   Minimum data
*   No overhead calculation
*   Ideal for Etsy/small shop/home business

# ✅ **4. SIMPLE WORKED EXAMPLE (Bedsheet)**

Let’s assume one queen bedsheet from all scales.

***

## 🟦 **Large Scale Example**

    1. Fabric: 5.2 sqm × 130 GSM × price/kg → $2.40  
    2. Weaving: 12 min × $0.10 = $1.20  
    3. Dye/Print: $0.45  
    4. Cutting: 1 min × $0.12 = $0.12  
    5. Stitching: 4 min × $0.15 = $0.60  
    6. QC + Packing: $0.25  
    7. Overhead (15%): $0.72
    --------------------------------
    Total = $5.74

***

## 🟩 **Medium Scale Example**

    1. Fabric: $2.40  
    2. Dye/Print: $0.40  
    3. Labor (cut+stitch): $0.75  
    4. Packing: $0.20  
    5. Overhead 12%: $0.46  
    --------------------------------
    Total = $4.21

***

## 🟧 **Small Scale Example**

    1. Fabric: $2.40  
    2. Dye/Print job work: $0.35  
    3. Stitching: $0.50  
    4. Packing: $0.10  
    5. Overhead: $0.10  
    --------------------------------
    Total = $3.45

***

## 🟨 **Extra Small Example**

    1. Fabric: $2.40  
    2. Tailor charge: $0.40  
    3. Packing: $0.05  
    --------------------------------
    Total = $2.85

***

# ✅ **5. Why the Cost Differs Across Scales**

| Scale           | Reason Cost Differs                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large**       | Includes efficiency loss, overhead, SMV, QA, multiple processes |
| **Medium**      | Uses simpler overhead, combined processes                       |
| **Small**       | Uses job‑work rates, no overhead allocation                     |
| **Extra Small** | Only material + labor                                           |

***

# ✅ **6. Final Summary (Super Simple)**

### **Same formula works for all scales:**

    Total Cost = Material + Processing + Labor + Overheads + Wastage

### **Difference is only in the detail level:**

*   **Large** → very detailed
*   **Medium** → balanced
*   **Small** → simple, based on job-rate
*   **Extra-small** → material + stitching only
